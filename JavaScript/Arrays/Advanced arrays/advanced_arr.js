/*
==================== Advanced JavaScript Arrays ==================== 
*/


/*
    ==================== Easy Level: ====================
    Given an array of integers, use the `map` function to add 5 to each number in the array.
*/



/*
    ==================== Medium Level: ====================
    From an array of numbers, use the `filter` function to keep only numbers that are greater than or equal to 20.
*/



/*
    ==================== Hard Level: ====================
    Given an array of prices (as numbers), use the `reduce` method to find the total cost.
*/



/*
    ==================== Very Hard Level: ====================
    You have an array of objects, where each object represents a person with a `name` and `numberOfBooksRead` property. Use the `filter` method to find all people who have read more than 10 books, and then use `map` to create an array of their names.
