/*
==================== Advanced JavaScript Arrays ==================== 
*/


/*
    ==================== Easy Level: ====================
    Create an array of numbers and use the `map` function to square each number in the array.
*/



/*
    ==================== Medium Level: ====================
    From an array of numbers, use the `filter` function to filter out odd numbers.
*/



/*
    ==================== Hard Level: ====================
    Use the `reduce` method to find the product of an array of numbers.
*/


/*
    ==================== Very Hard Level: ====================
    Given an array of people objects with properties `name` and `age`, write a function that checks if every person is above 18 years old using the `every` method. Also find the first person who is older than 30 using the `find` method.
