    Lesson: For Loops

    In JavaScript, a "for loop" is a control flow statement that allows code to be repeatedly executed. A for loop is characterized by three statements (usually) enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons:

    1. The initialization statement: This is executed before the loop starts.
    2. The condition statement: The loop will continue as long as this condition is true.
    3. The final-expression statement: This is executed at the end of each loop iteration.

    Here's the syntax:

    for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression]) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

    The initialization statement is executed only once before the start of the loop. The condition statement is evaluated before each loop iteration. If it returns true, the loop continues; otherwise, the loop stops. After every iteration, the final-expression is executed.


    Easy Level:
        1. Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.

/*
    Medium Level:
        2. Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 and stores the result in a variable called total. Then, print the value of total after the loop finishes.

    Hard Level:
        3. Write a for loop that iterates from 0 to 100. For each iteration, check if the current number is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is, print "FizzBuzz". If it's only divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If it's only divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If none of these conditions are met, print the number itself.

    Very Hard Level:
        4. Write a for loop that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Print the sequence at the end of the loop.
