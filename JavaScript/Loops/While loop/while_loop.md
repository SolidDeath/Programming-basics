# JavaScript Arrays

## Explanation

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. You can access elements of an array by referring to the index number. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at position 0.

Arrays are declared like this: `let arrayName = [element1, element2, element3];`

## How to Use

You can access an element in the array like this: `arrayName[indexNumber]`

## Example and Output

Here's an example of creating an array, accessing an element, and changing an element:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

console.log(fruits[1]); // Outputs: Banana

fruits[1] = "Blueberry";
console.log(fruits); // Outputs: ["Apple", "Blueberry", "Cherry"]
```
