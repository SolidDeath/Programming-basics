    Lesson: While Loops

    A "while loop" is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. The loop can be thought of as a repeating 'if' statement. The test condition is checked first, and if it's true, the code block within the loop is executed. The process continues until the test condition evaluates to false.

    Here's the syntax:

    while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

    The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it's true, the loop continues. If it's false, the loop ends, and the program control moves to the next statement after the loop.

    Now, let's get into some tasks!

    Easy Level:
        1. Write a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.

/*
    Medium Level:
    2. Write a while loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 and stores the result in a variable called total. Then, print the value of total after the loop finishes.

/*
    Hard Level:
    3. Write a while loop that iterates from 0 to 100. For each iteration, check if the current number is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is, print "FizzBuzz". If it's only divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If it's only divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If none of these conditions are met, print the number itself.

/*
    Very Hard Level:
    4. Write a while loop that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Print the sequence at the end of the loop.

    Just like before, the HTML page setup would look like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>JavaScript Lesson</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="your-js-file.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>

Replace "your-js-file.js" with the actual name of your JavaScript file.
